            and since he had and idea in coding, he would give all these amazing commands for the prototype to perform
            and<br> they would perform them to the later. This was so interesting to me and i started abit of research on
            coding. <br>So when he told me about the school i was so much interested but the fee was abit high, then when he
            heard about the access programme<br> he told me, i applied and here i am.</p>
